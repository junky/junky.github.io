Eligible participants will receive a free at-home Sano DNA Test as part of the study and will have full access to, and control of, their DNA data via the Sano Genetics platform.","eligibility_definition":{"children":[{"field":"age","op":"gte","survey":"Ji2tsd88cLUdEM45Y09zba","type":"int","value":18},{"field":"location","op":"sub","survey":"Ji2tsd88cLUdEM45Y09zba","type":"text","value":"UK"},{"type":"is_representing_myself","value":true},{"children":[{"field":"consent","op":"eq","survey":"qWPAFbfQdAV3unoAvKbNzg","type":"consent","value":"yes"},{"field":"willing_to_take_followup_surveys","op":"eq","survey":"qWPAFbfQdAV3unoAvKbNzg","type":"text","value":"Yes"}],"prescreen":true,"survey":"qWPAFbfQdAV3unoAvKbNzg","type":"and"}],"type":"and"},"eligibility_outcome_msg":null,"end":"2022-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","has_kit_process":true,"id":"gAzFJ3uFxASnRfEq2ShJ2T","key":"gold","kit_type":null,"landing_share_text":"","linkout_form":null,"linkout_url_form":null,"marketing_info_url":null,"no_longer_active_exp":null,"participant_revenue":null,"participant_target":null,"partner_revenue":null,"partner_visible":false,"prescreen_survey":"qWPAFbfQdAV3unoAvKbNzg","published":false,"recruiting_for":false,"reminder_emails":3,"requires_dna_data":false,"researcher":"","researcher_email":"","researcher_image_link":null,"review":false,"rewards":null,"show_funnel":false,"snp_info":null,"sponsor_lead":null,"start":"2021-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","tags":["Ethically approved","University or non-profit study","Free DNA Test"],"title":"Long COVID - GOLD study","type_of_study":"sano-platform","updated_at":"2021-07-05T14:37:52.582053+00:00","uses_standard_landing_flow":false,"visible":true},{"client_codes":null,"created_at":"2018-12-21T16:30:46+00:00","currency":"USD","custom_landing_title":"","description_contd":null,"description_summary":"How does genetics influence susceptibility to severe food allergies, including peanut, egg, dairy, and gluten.","eligibility_definition":null,"eligibility_outcome_msg":null,"end":"2020-06-30T22:59:00+00:00","has_kit_process":false,"id":"QdHxcA8sdbjxYZpjNtyS77","key":"severe-food-allergies","kit_type":null,"landing_share_text":"","linkout_form":null,"linkout_url_form":null,"marketing_info_url":null,"no_longer_active_exp":null,"participant_revenue":null,"participant_target":null,"partner_revenue":null,"partner_visible":false,"prescreen_survey":null,"published":true,"recruiting_for":false,"reminder_emails":3,"requires_dna_data":false,"researcher":"Sano Genetics","researcher_email":"","researcher_image_link":"","review":false,"rewards":null,"show_funnel":false,"snp_info":null,"sponsor_lead":null,"start":"2018-12-21T16:30:00+00:00","tags":null,"title":"Severe Food Allergies","type_of_study":"","updated_at":"2020-11-17T18:26:56.644391+00:00","uses_standard_landing_flow":false,"visible":true}]
